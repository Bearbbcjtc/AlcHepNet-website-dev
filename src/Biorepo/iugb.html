          <p class="lead">
            The Indiana Biobank was established in 2010 and is intended to be a resource to promote discovery research.
            We offer a variety of services to meet this aim. Each year, we provide researchers over 4000 sample
            collection kits, bank samples for over 30 biobanks, support over 15 targeted collections, distribute
            thousands of specimens and omics data, and collect over 10,000 specimens for broad sharing. Currently, over
            50,000 patients have consented to be a part of the Indiana Biobank.
          </p>

            The Indiana Biobank is a statewide initiative, co-developed by Indiana University School of Medicine and IU
            Health to collect blood specimens through the Indiana Biobank for genomic sequencing. The specimens and
            information can be used in research to find better treatments for diseases of today and the future.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            IU Health patients can participate in this effort by donating blood samples. Patients who are already in the
            lab for a scheduled blood draw can consent in-person or may consent remotely for a future draw. The Indiana
            Biobank can also use blood specimens left over from other procedures. Patients who participate are
            automatically enrolled in the All IN for Health program initiative and will receive a newsletter that
            provides resources for good health and opportunities to participate in more health research and clinical
            studies. The goal of the project is to enroll 300,000 IU Health patients over the next five years.
