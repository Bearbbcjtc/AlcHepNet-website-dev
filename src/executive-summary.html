			<p class="lead">
				The purpose of this
				research study is to create
				a clinical database and
				bio-repository. To do this,
				we will obtain blood,
				urine, and stool samples
				(e.g., biological samples)
				and personal health
				information from you to
				use in future research
				studies related to
				alcohol-associated hepatitis or
				other diseases. Part of
				your blood sample will be
				used to extract your DNA.
				DNA is the genetic
				material that gives us
				unique characteristics. We
				are doing this research
				study because we are
				trying to find out more
				about how and why
				illnesses related to
				alcohol-associated hepatitis or
				other diseases occur in
				people. To do this, we will
				study the biological
				samples and personal
				health information from
				healthy and sick people.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				A "biological sample" is
				usually blood, but can be
				any body fluid. "Personal
				Health Information"
				includes such items as
				your name, age, gender,
				race, and/or your medical
				information. It can also
				include data from
				measurements and tests
				that you had while
				participating in another
				research study or that
				were done during the
				course of your regular
				medical care or doctor
				visits.
			</p>
			<h4>Study Type</h4>
			<p class="lead">
				Prospective, observational study
			</p>
            <h4>Investigational Sites</h4>
			<p class="lead">
				Indiana University; University of Louisville affiliated hospitals in Kentucky; University of Massachusetts Medical 
				Center in Massachusetts; Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota; Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio; University of 
				Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania; University of Texas at Southwestern in Dallas, Texas; and Virginia 
				Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia
			</p>
			<h4>Planned Number of Patients</h4>
			<p class="lead">
				Approximately 1260 (720 subjects with alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), 
				360 heavy drinkers without AH, and 180 healthy donors) will be enrolled.  
			</p>
			
			<h4>Objectives</h4>
			
			
			<p class="lead">
				<span class="objective-title">PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:</span> To collect and store clinical data to facilitate 
				investigations of the epidemiology, diagnosis, pathophysiology, natural history, 
				and treatment of alcohol-associated hepatitis.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				<span class="objective-title">SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: </span> To develop a bio-specimen bank comprised of plasma, 
				DNA, and other biological specimens obtained from patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis, 
				heavy drinkers without clinical liver disease, and healthy subjects to support translational 
				research in the pathophysiology of alcohol-associated hepatitis
			</p>
			
			<h4>Methodology</h4>
				<p class="lead">
					<span class="phase-title">Screening phase:</span> Subjects will be assessed for the eligibility criteria and a written informed consent 
					will be obtained from the eligible subjects. 
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					<span class="phase-title">Study phase:</span>  Subjects will undergo history taking, physical examination, questionnaire administration, 
					and laboratory tests. Biosamples including serum/plasma, peripheral mononuclear cells (at select sites), 
					genomic DNA, stool samples (when available), urine, and liver tissue (where available) will be obtained. 
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					<span class="phase-title">Follow up phase:</span>  Alcohol-associated hepatitis subjects will be followed for 360 days, Heavy drinking controls for 
					180 days, and healthy controls subjects for 1 day (at initial meeting for baseline).
