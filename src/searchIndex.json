    "content": "Executive Summary ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED HEPATITIS NETWORK OBSERVATIONAL STUDY The purpose of this research study is to create a clinical database and bio-repository. To do this, we will obtain blood, urine, and stool samples (e.g., biological samples) and personal health information from you to use in future research studies related to alcohol-associated hepatitis or other diseases. Part of your blood sample will be used to extract your DNA. DNA is the genetic material that gives us unique characteristics. We are doing this research study because we are trying to find out more about how and why illnesses related to alcohol-associated hepatitis or other diseases occur in people. To do this, we will study the biological samples and personal health information from healthy and sick people. A \"biological sample\" is usually blood, but can be any body fluid. \"Personal Health Information\" includes such items as your name, age, gender, race, and/or your medical information. It can also include data from measurements and tests that you had while participating in another research study or that were done during the course of your regular medical care or doctor visits. Study Type Prospective, observational study Investigational Sites Indiana University; University of Louisville affiliated hospitals in Kentucky; University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Massachusetts; Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota; Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio; University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania; University of Texas at Southwestern in Dallas, Texas; and Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia Planned Number of Patients Approximately 1260 (720 subjects with alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), 360 heavy drinkers without AH, and 180 healthy donors) will be enrolled. Objectives PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To collect and store clinical data to facilitate investigations of the epidemiology, diagnosis, pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment of alcohol-associated hepatitis. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To develop a bio-specimen bank comprised of plasma, DNA, and other biological specimens obtained from patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis, heavy drinkers without clinical liver disease, and healthy subjects to support translational research in the pathophysiology of alcohol-associated hepatitis Methodology Screening phase: Subjects will be assessed for the eligibility criteria and a written informed consent will be obtained from the eligible subjects. Study phase: Subjects will undergo history taking, physical examination, questionnaire administration, and laboratory tests. Biosamples including serum/plasma, peripheral mononuclear cells (at select sites), genomic DNA, stool samples (when available), urine, and liver tissue (where available) will be obtained. Follow up phase: Alcohol-associated hepatitis subjects will be followed for 360 days, Heavy drinking controls for 180 days, and healthy controls subjects for 1 day (at initial meeting for baseline). $(function () { $(\"#navbar-include\").load(\"navbar.html\", function () { console.log('Navbar loaded'); }); $(\"#search-modal-include\").load(\"search-modal.html\"); $(\"#footer-include\").load(\"footer.html\", function () { console.log('Footer loaded'); }); });"

Browse Previous Next About AlcHepNet The Alcohol-associated Hepatitis Network project, AlcHepNet, comprised of ten leading partner institutions in the field, will collect and organize patient information, associated data, and samples that can help shed greater light on this disease. Combined, these approaches will improve treatment and how we care for patients with this devastating liver condition. A Twitter List by AlcHepNet Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. This network represents a coordinated submission of several NIAAA-funded consortia that have come together as the Alcohol-associated Hepatitis Network (AlcHepNet). Collectively, the network will synergize efforts and expertise to better understand AH. The network aims to: Develop a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial focused on the treatment of severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (sAH) and alcohol use disorder (AUD). The primary purpose study is to determine whether subjects receiving AUD treatments combined with sAH therapies will improve alcohol and liver-related events at 6 months compared to usual care for AUD. Patients will receive either integrated treatment with acamprosate and counseling or standard care with brief advice and referral to a 12-step program. The secondary purpose of the study is to determine if F-652 is safe and effective in treating severe alcohol-associated hepatitis when compared to prednisone. Subjects will receive F-652 on days 1 and 7 or prednisone for 28 days. Outcomes will be measured by overall survival at 90 days.

Name of Active Ingredient(s) Anakinra Prednisone Zinc-Sulfate Pharmacological Class of the Drugs Anakinra is immunological agent, an inhibitor of the Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1). Prednisone is an adrenal glucocorticoid. Zinc-sulfate is a nutritional supplement. Indication Severe alcoholic hepatitis. Study Type Phase 2B multicenter randomized, 2-arm, double blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial. Investigational Sites Indiana University, Mayo Clinic, Virginia Commonwealth University, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, University of Louisville, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Planned Number of Participants Approximately 258 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment arms (129 participants per arm): (1) Prednisone + Placebo for Anakinra/Zinc (2) Anakinra + Zinc + Placebo for Prednisone. Objectives This multicenter, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial is focused on novel treatments for severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH), a life-threatening stage of alcoholic liver injury that has a short-term mortality rate much higher than that of other liver diseases. The primary objective of the study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of Anakinra (plus zinc) compared to the current standard medical treatment consisting of prednisone in participants with clinically severe AH. Key secondary objectives broadly are as follows: (a) to evaluate the use of biomarkers to assess disease severity and treatment response; and (b) to develop novel endpoints to overcome the limitations of current assessment strategies for severe AH. Overview of Study Design and Conduct The proposed study is a Phase 2b, multicenter, prospective, randomized, 2-arm, double blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of Anakinra, an interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist plus zinc compared to prednisone for the treatment of severe AH (Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score ≥ 20). All participants will receive standard care for treatment of severe AH as described in recent guidelines endorsed by American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). The study will be conducted at 8 clinical sites across the United Stated selected by the National Institute of Alcoholic Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and will be supported by a Data Coordinating Center at Indiana University (DCC-IU). The biorepository will be managed by University of Massachusetts. The study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in compliance with local, state and federal regulatory requirements. Adverse events during the course of the trial will be identified, recorded, assessed for causality, and reported in accordance with FDA guidance. In addition to general assessment, we will specifically focus on (1) rates and types of infection as well as their severity, (2) potential development of drug-induced liver injury, (3) injection site reactions, and (4) hematological adverse events. This study will be approved by an appropriately convened single IRB, Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB), and will be monitored by an NIAAA appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). We will conduct this study under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is anticipated that a centrally located investigational pharmacy located at Indiana University will dispense the study medications to all participating sites under close coordination from the DCC-IU. Anakinra plus zinc, prednisone and matching placebos will be provided by the study to the participants. Interventions to be tested Concomitant treatments in this trial include standard care for severe AH for all participants as recommended in recent guidelines 1. The standard of care for severe AH includes attention to early diagnosis and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections, portal hypertension and its complications including acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, fluid overload (ascites and edema) and hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, all participants will be offered as part of the standard of care, non-pharmacologic intervention for treatment of alcohol use disorders, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and 12-step programs intervention as aligned with the best practices at the participating study site. Participants with severe AH are very sick and often have multiple active medical problems requiring intervention. The use of specific interventions during this time has the potential to modify treatment response. Ideally, these interventions would be completely standardized. However, the standard of care varies by region, institution and the specialties involved in the care of the participant. The decision regarding treatments for these complications will be delegated to the primary physicians caring for the participants during hospitalizations and to the investigators during the ambulatory follow-up of the participants. Other than the general guidelines noted, no specific treatments for specific complications such as those noted are required. However, such treatments might include, but are not limited to the administration of IV fluids, intravenous human serum albumin, antibiotics including antifungal medications, renal replacement therapy, supplemental oxygen, assisted ventilation and intravenous pressors. Diagnostic procedures such as paracentesis, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound and liver biopsy will be permitted as required to provide standard care. During the initial six months of trial, the investigators will develop a \"manual of clinical operations\" that will include best practices on the use of vasopressors, albumin, ICU care, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy using Surviving Sepsis Campaign, International Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock. The investigators will also provide best practices for management of nutrition and alcohol counseling and minimization of recidivism. Although the management of these complications will not be mandated by protocol, the care provided will be recorded to develop novel designs for future trials and for practice guidance and quality improvement programs. After informed consent has been obtained and all of the inclusion are met and none of the exclusion, participants will be randomized to receive one of the following interventions in addition to standard care. Group 1: Standard of care plus prednisone 40 mg orally once daily on Days 1-30 and matching placebos for Anakinra (1 syringe s.c. once daily on Days 1-14), and zinc (matched pill once daily on Days 1-90). Group 2: Standard of care plus Anakinra (100 mg s.c.) once daily on Days 1-14 zinc sulfate 220 mg once daily on Days 1-90, and placebo for prednisone (matched pill once daily on Days 1-30). Figure 1. Distribution of study drug and placebo Participants or guardian will be instructed in subcutaneous injection technique to continue self-administration of these experimental treatments after discharge from the hospital. Study personnel will ensure participants and guardian are proficient in the technique before the end of study visit and an instructional document will be provided. Primary and Important Secondary Endpoints Primary Endpoints Survival at 90 days Secondary Endpoints Changes in score(s): Changes in Lille score, change in MELD score, development of AKI, multi-organ failure, SIRS, transfer to ICU, changes in liver function will all be evaluated at 7, 30 and 90 days. Organ dysfunction: Measure of changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and proportions requiring hemodynamic support for MAP < 65 mm Hg and lactate > 2 mmol/l, renal replacement therapy or mechanical ventilation. The SOFA score will be modified and re-evaluated without platelet counts given that these are usually low in AH. Infections and Sepsis: The endpoints and case definitions related to sepsis may vary depending on what will be used (clinical care, research, surveillance or quality improvement). Given the central role of sepsis as a driver of outcomes, measuring the types of infection will occur but also identify the proportions of those with sepsis, septic shock or quick-SOFA (qSOFA) criteria based on SEPSIS-3 guidance 2, 3 . Key parameters will be captured and needed for various sepsis related endpoint construction aligned by the recent guidance from the European Drug Development Hub (http://eddh-cro.wixsite.com/fdtsfv). Renal dysfunction: In alignment with guidance from the acute disease quality initiative, the AKI development will be quantified and its progression through persistent AKI, acute kidney disease to chronic kidney disease. Need for care escalation: Proportion of participants requiring transfer to ICU for care, intubation for airway control, need for ventilator support or RRT. Indicators of gut permeability: (endotoxin and bacterial 18S DNA) and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokines (TNFa, MCP1, IL-6, IL-1ß) will be assessed in serum/plasma samples. Survival at 30 days and 180 days Limitations of mortality as an endpoint in AH and plans to overcome these All-cause mortality is most relevant when mortality is substantial and attributable to a single mechanism in a homogeneous population. Participants with severe AH are highly heterogeneous with respect to disease severity, end organ involvement and the care they receive. Moreover, as in sepsis and heart failure, death involves failure of multiple organs (liver, heart, kidney, lungs) making it difficult to ascertain which one is the primary cause of death. This has led to development and regulatory acceptance of composite endpoints including mortality and key parameters driving mortality for acute heart failure trials. These guiding principles to construct a novel and innovative key secondary composite endpoint which will include death or worsening of the modified SOFA score 4, 5 by ≥2 points and worsening of MELD score by ≥2 points. These are associated with mortality and capture the organ recruitment that marks progression of AH towards death. This endpoint will also be validated with respect to reliability, construct-, criterion- and content validity to establish this as a primary endpoint in future trials. Model changes in SOFA scores and MELD scores against mortality to further optimize this endpoint and cross-validate it in the observation cohort will occur. Novel (experimental) endpoints to overcome limitations of conventional endpoints Efficacy endpoints must capture \"clinically meaningful benefit\". While traditional endpoints such as mortality are meaningful, they also have multiple shortcomings in the context of AH as noted below. Innovation will be used to construct, measure and validate novel additional endpoints to overcome the limitations of currently used endpoints and cross-validate them in the observational cohort. The combined expertise in endpoint development and the use of harmonized measurements will make this feasible. These will provide novel assessments in AH and provide the scientific evidence-base to use these as primary endpoints in future trials.

Investigational Sites Indiana University, Mayo Clinic, Virginia Commonwealth University, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, University of Louisville, and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Planned number of Participants A total of 216 participants with sAH will be enrolled sequentially randomized into four treatment groups Objectives: To determine whether interventions directed to treat AUD integrated with sAH therapies will improve a composite endpoint of alcohol and liver-related events at 6 months compared to usual care for AUD (primary endpoint). To compare 90-day survival in patients receiving F-652 with those receiving up to 28 days of prednisone using the Day-7 Lille score as a stopping rule (secondary endpoint). To compare one-year overall survival in patients receiving either IL-22 or prednisone with or without acamprosate (secondary endpoint). Trial design and conduct We will conduct a prospective, multicenter, sequentially randomized trial in 216 patients with sAH using a sequentially randomized design for proof of concept. The trial will assess whether integrated treatment of sAH and alcohol use disorder (AUD) reduces alcohol- and liver-related events and mortality. The trial design resembles a 2X2 factorial study, but the AUD treatment assignment [acamprosate + motivational interviewing (MI) + motivational enhancement therapy (MET)] versus usual care (UC), defined as a brief intervention with advice not to drink alcohol-containing beverages and referral to a 12-step program, is done on Day 7 after the start of the sAH treatment. Only survivors of the first 7 days will be randomized to receive the AUD intervention or UC. Figure 1. Diagram of trial design Abbreviations: R: randomization, AUD: alcohol use disorder, MI: motivational interviewing, MET: motivational enhancement therapy. The study will be conducted at six clinical sites in the United States selected by the National Institute of Alcoholic Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and supported by a Data Coordinating Center at Indiana University (DCC). The DCC will also manage the biorepository. The study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in compliance with local, state, and federal regulatory requirements.

In addition to general assessment, we will specifically focus on (1) rates and types of infection as well as their severity, (2) potential development of drug-induced liver injury, (3) injection site reactions, and (4) hematological adverse events. This study will be approved by an appropriately convened single IRB, Advarra, and will be monitored by an NIAAA-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). We will conduct this study under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is anticipated that a centrally located investigational pharmacy at Indiana University will dispense the study medications to all participating sites under close coordination from the DCC. The study will provide the participants with F-652, prednisone, matching placebos, and acamprosate. Duration of Trial by Phase Treatment phase: up to 6 months Follow-up phase: up to two years Interventions to be tested F-652 vs. prednisone as treatment for sAH. AUD interventions (acamprosate + MI + MET) versus usual care for AUD treatment. Group assignment: We will sequentially randomize the study participants into four treatment groups. On day 1, participants will be randomized to receive either F-652 or prednisone at a 1-to-1 ratio. Those randomized to receive F-652 will also receive a prednisone placebo; those randomized to receive prednisone will receive the F-652 placebo. Prednisone or prednisone placebo will be stopped if the Day-7 Lille score is >0.45. On day 7, survivors will be randomized to receive either the AUD intervention (acamprosate + MI + MET) or usual care at a 1-to-1 ratio. Block randomization will be used to ensure balanced group sizes in randomization. So, there will be four treatment combinations: ARM 1: F-652 on days 1 and 7 and matching placebos for prednisone for 28 days and acamprosate for 6 months. MI will be delivered during the hospitalization; MET sessions will be delivered in the first 3 months. ARM 2: F-652 on days 1 and 7 and matching placebo for prednisone for 28 days and usual care for AUD. ARM 3: Prednisone for 28 days and matching placebos for F-652 on days 1 and 7 and acamprosate for 6 months. MI will be delivered during the hospitalization; MET sessions will be delivered in the first 3 months. ARM 4: Prednisone for 28 days and matching placebo for F-652 on days 1 and 7 and usual care for AUD. $(function() { $(\"#navbar-include\").load(\"navbar.html\", function() { console.log('Navbar loaded'); }); $(\"#search-modal-include\").load(\"search-modal.html\"); $(\"#footer-include\").load(\"footer.html\", function() { console.log('Footer loaded'); }); });"
